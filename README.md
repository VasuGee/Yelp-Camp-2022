# Yelp-Camp-2022
A Yelp Clone, made using the MERN stack
A Yelp Clone, made using the MERN stack, without ReactJs. It is a lightweight Yelp Clone for Campgrounds, supporting full CRUD functionality. Working with three interlinked Mongoose models, it provides the user the ability to create/update campgrounds, leave reviews & images for other users' reference. Currently, only locally hosted. It is a guided project, made as part of The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 by Colt Steele on udemy. The project will be deployed using heroku, once I incorporate Cluster Maps from Mapbox & personalize the web experience. Refer to the uploaded PDF, for comprehensive tech stack breakdown.
